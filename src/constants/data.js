    text: "One of my recent projects involved using new technologies like React Router and Firebase. The website allows users to view vacation rental properties, search for available dates, and book selected houses and additional services. All bookings are stored in Firebase, and once a booking is made, the property becomes unavailable for future searches on those dates. Additionally, users can receive a discount certificate via email after a simulated payment, facilitated by EmailJS. The project also incorporated various libraries for animations, smooth page transitions, and form validation.",

    text: "This JavaScript game is my largest project to date, taking around six months to develop. Simple Factory features isometric 2D graphics created without engines or libraries. Most visual content, such as factory models and items, was designed by me using MagicaVoxel. The game focuses on automating processes like mining resources, transporting them via conveyor belts or vehicles, and gradually processing and converting them into finished products. It includes about 50 different materials and products, as well as numerous factories and plants for resource extraction and processing. Throughout development, I encountered many serious challenges, which greatly enhanced my JavaScript skills",

    text: "GD-Consulting was my first collaborative project, developed with a friend. It involved creating a multi-page website where we worked together to build a fully functional site based on a Figma mockup. To coordinate our efforts efficiently, we used GitHub for version control and project management.We divided the tasks according to our strengths and started working on different sections of the site simultaneously. This approach allowed us to make steady progress and integrate our work seamlessly. This project provided valuable experience in teamwork, collaboration, and managing a shared codebase, enhancing both my technical skills and my ability to work effectively with others.",
